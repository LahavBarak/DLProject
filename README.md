## Introduction
This repo is part of a student project in deep learning course.
This project attempts to improve upon the method of image generation with encoder-decoder system by adding a layer of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
Encoder-Decoder system takes a dataset of images (we used MNIST), encodes it into a 2d space called latent-space, and can later decode it back into image space.
after learning the relations between image space and latent space, the decoder is able to produce new images by getting points in latent space.

GAN employs a generator and discriminator. the generator creates fake images, and feeds them to the discriminator, which is also provided with real images. the discriminator takes then attempts to identify whether an image is fake or real.
the training process of the GAN makes the generator learn to better fool the discriminator, while the discriminator learns to better tell fake from real imagery.

This project uses the Encoder-Decoder system as the generator for the GAN, and attempts to use this method to improve the decoder's ability to reproduce better images.
